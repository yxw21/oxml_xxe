# Main Modes

There are two main modes:

## Build a File

Build mode adds a DOCTYPE and inserts the XML Entity into the file of the users choice.

## String Replace in File

String replacement mode goes through and looks for the symbol ยง in the document. The XML Entity ("&xxe;") replaces any instances of this symbol. Note, you can open the document in and insert ยง anywhere to have it replaced. The common use case would be a web application which reads in a xlsx and then prints the results to the screen. Exploiting the XXE it would be possible to have the contents printed to the screen.
